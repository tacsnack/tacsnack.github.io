description: Embedded firmware comes with its own suite of difficulties. Luckily I have been working in the embedded world for most of my career and am very comfortable navigating C/C++ and Rust code bases. Need some changes made to a previously abandoned project? No problem! Need to whip up a PoC on a tight timeline? I can also help with that.
